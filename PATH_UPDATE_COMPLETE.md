  const envPath = process.env.RESOURCE_IMPORT_PATH;
- const defaultPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'resources-import');
+ const defaultPath = 'C:/Users/jline/OneDrive/Desktop/resources';
  
  if (envPath) {
    console.log('[SCAN] Using RESOURCE_IMPORT_PATH from environment:', envPath);
    return envPath;
  } else {
-   console.log('[SCAN] RESOURCE_IMPORT_PATH not set, using default:', defaultPath);
+   console.log('[SCAN] RESOURCE_IMPORT_PATH not set, using default desktop path:', defaultPath);
    return defaultPath;
  }
};
```

### **2. Updated .env.local** ✅

**Added:**
```bash
RESOURCE_IMPORT_PATH=C:/Users/jline/OneDrive/Desktop/resources
```

**Verification:**

## ⚠️ Action Required: Reorganize Files

The scan system expects files to be organized by **type** (ebooks, checklists, guides), not by product name.

### Option 1: Manual Reorganization (Recommended)

```powershell
# 1. Create type-based folders
mkdir "C:\Users\jline\OneDrive\Desktop\resources\guides"
mkdir "C:\Users\jline\OneDrive\Desktop\resources\checklists"
mkdir "C:\Users\jline\OneDrive\Desktop\resources\covers"

# 2. Move files to appropriate folders
# For example:
# Move: The-30-Day-Customer-Retention-Roadmap---Guide-/.../...Guide.pdf
# To:   guides/30-day-customer-retention-roadmap.pdf

# Move: Converting...Checklist/.../...pdf
# To:   checklists/converting-first-time-buyers.pdf

# 3. Move cover images
# Move all .jpg files to covers/ folder
```

### Option 2: Quick Script (PowerShell)

Create this as a helper script to reorganize:

```powershell
# Save as: reorganize-resources.ps1
$base = "C:\Users\jline\OneDrive\Desktop\resources"

# Create type folders
New-Item -Path "$base\guides" -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path "$base\checklists" -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path "$base\covers" -ItemType Directory -Force

# Find all PDFs in subdirectories
Get-ChildItem -Path $base -Recurse -Filter "*.pdf" | ForEach-Object {
    $dest = "$base\guides\"
    
    # Determine type from name
    if ($_.Name -like "*checklist*") {
        $dest = "$base\checklists\"
    }
    
    # Copy (don't move, to preserve originals)
    Copy-Item $_.FullName -Destination $dest -Force
    Write-Host "Copied: $($_.Name) -> $dest"
}

# Copy all cover images
Get-ChildItem -Path $base -Recurse -Filter "*.jpg" | ForEach-Object {
    Copy-Item $_.FullName -Destination "$base\covers\" -Force
    Write-Host "Copied cover: $($_.Name)"
}
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start After Reorganization

Once files are organized correctly:

### 1. Verify Structure
```powershell
# Should show: ebooks, checklists, guides, covers, etc.
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\jline\OneDrive\Desktop\resources" -Directory | Select-Object Name
```

### 2. Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Scan
```
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to /admin/resources
3. Click "Import from Folder"
4. Should see your files in modal
```
